Certainly! Here's a simple example of how you can perform a basic analysis of doctor visit records using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('doctor_visits.csv')  # Replace 'doctor_visits.csv' with the path to your dataset

# Preview the data
print(data.head())

# Perform basic analysis
# Example 1: Count the number of doctor visits by gender
gender_counts = data['Gender'].value_counts()
print(gender_counts)

# Example 2: Visualize the distribution of age
plt.hist(data['Age'], bins=10, edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Distribution of Age')
plt.show()

# Example 3: Analyze the frequency of different diagnoses
diagnosis_counts = data['Diagnosis'].value_counts().head(10)
print(diagnosis_counts)

# Example 4: Calculate the average visit duration
avg_duration = data['Duration'].mean()
print(avg_duration)
```

In this example, we assume that you have a dataset named 'doctor_visits.csv' containing columns like 'Gender', 'Age', 'Diagnosis', and 'Duration'. You can modify the code according to your dataset's column names and structure.

This code snippet demonstrates how to load the dataset, perform basic analysis tasks like counting values and calculating averages, and visualize data using histograms.

Feel free to expand upon this code and add more complex analyses or visualizations based on your specific project requirements.
